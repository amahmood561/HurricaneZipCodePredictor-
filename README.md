# HurricaneZipCodePredictor-
hurricane zip code prediction mvp 
Creating a hurricane predictor specific to predicting the likelihood of hitting a particular zip code in Florida involves using historical hurricane data (like storm tracks, intensity, and impact zones) combined with weather features (wind speed, pressure, etc.). The model will predict the probability of a hurricane affecting a specific zip code.

Here's how to implement a basic version of such a predictor using a logistic regression model. 

Requirements for the Dataset
The dataset (hurricane_zip_data.csv) should include columns:
Features: WindSpeed, Pressure, Temperature, ZipCode.
Target: HurricaneHit (1 for hit, 0 for no hit).
The dataset should have historical weather data and information about whether each zip code was affected by a hurricane.

python hurricane_predictor.py --data hurricane_zip_data.csv --wind_speed 150 --pressure 980 --temperature 28 --zip_code 33101


Explanation
argparse: This module is used to handle command-line arguments, allowing users to provide input data for prediction directly from the terminal.
CLI Arguments:
--data: The path to the CSV file containing the hurricane data.
--wind_speed, --pressure, --temperature, --zip_code: Features for making predictions.
Script Execution:
When the script is executed, it trains the model using the specified dataset.
Takes user-provided input data and prints the predicted likelihood of a hurricane hitting the specified zip code.
This CLI version makes the hurricane predictor flexible, allowing users to quickly train and make predictions using their datasets and input parameters.



Next Steps
Enhance the Model: Experiment with more complex models (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks) to improve predictions.
Feature Engineering: Add more features like Humidity, SeaSurfaceTemperature, StormDirection, and historical hurricane data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model using Grid Search or Random Search for better performance.
