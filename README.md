# HurricaneZipCodePredictor-
hurricane zip code prediction mvp 
Creating a hurricane predictor specific to predicting the likelihood of hitting a particular zip code in Florida involves using historical hurricane data (like storm tracks, intensity, and impact zones) combined with weather features (wind speed, pressure, etc.). The model will predict the probability of a hurricane affecting a specific zip code.

Here's how to implement a basic version of such a predictor using a logistic regression model. 

Requirements for the Dataset
The dataset (hurricane_zip_data.csv) should include columns:
Features: WindSpeed, Pressure, Temperature, ZipCode.
Target: HurricaneHit (1 for hit, 0 for no hit).
The dataset should have historical weather data and information about whether each zip code was affected by a hurricane.

Next Steps
Enhance the Model: Experiment with more complex models (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks) to improve predictions.
Feature Engineering: Add more features like Humidity, SeaSurfaceTemperature, StormDirection, and historical hurricane data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model using Grid Search or Random Search for better performance.
